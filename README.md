# Falchion

Falchion is a JVM container for the fault tolerant server.
Falchion container requires JDK9 because it's using SO_REUSEPORT flag. JDK9 supports SO_REUSEPORT only on Linux.

When the container has started, it forks JVM processes until the given pool size.
If the container catch a HUP signal, it creates a new JVM processes and kill old processes.

## Options

- -cp  Classpath
- -p   The pool size of JVM processes. (default value is 1)
- --lifetime LIFETIME SECONDS  The lifetime of one jvm process. If you set the option to 3600, container will kill all old JVMs and create new JVMs gracefully.
- -m MONITORS  Adds monitors for monitoring a jvm process.
  Available monitors:
    - JSTAT_GCUTIL  GC statistics using jstat
    - METRICS_JMX   Metrics using JMX
- --auto-tuning  tuning JVM parameters automatically.
- --evaluator EVALUATOR
